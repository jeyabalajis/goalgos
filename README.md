# goalgos
A curated set of algorithms that exploit the __power__ and __simplicity__ of _golang_.

All the algorithms use the following concepts for efficient execution:
- Recursion: The core function is written first and it is called recursively.
- Parallelism: Every unit of work (or) a recursive call is submitted as a go routine for efficient processing
